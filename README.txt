The idea behind this mod is to reduce the cost of Deployment in CR for ships by a multiplier.
You can edit this multiplier in data\config\modSettings.json
You can use any value between 0-100 with decimals, if you use less than 0 mod will replace it with 0,
if you put anything over 100 it will replace it with 100.

Edit 30.04.2024
Be aware that CR is tied to ship price calculation, if you set it to 0 the ship prices will go to max integer values which is over 2 billion, for the lowest setting I would recommend between 0.05 and 0.1 as the prices will be still manageable.
